title: Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease
description: >-
  This study explores machine learning methods for early prediction of ADRD using RWD from EHRs. Four computable phenotypes (CPs) identified cases with a 1:10 control match. Logistic regression and gradient boosting tree models were applied across prediction windows of 0, 1, 3, and 5 years. The data-driven model achieved an AUC of 0.854 for 5-year prediction.

### Key Insights

- **Data Source**: EHR data from the OneFlorida+ Research Consortium, covering 23,835 ADRD patients and over 1 million controls.
- **Techniques**: Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) models outperformed logistic regression, achieving predictive accuracies (AUC) of 0.939 (immediate), 0.906 (1 year), 0.884 (3 years), and 0.854 (5 years before diagnosis).
- **Features**: Models used both knowledge-driven (expert-selected) and data-driven (machine-discovered) features, with data-driven approaches yielding superior results.

### Methodology

1. **Knowledge-Driven Approach**: Leveraged established ADRD risk factors (e.g., stroke, depression, diabetes).
2. **Data-Driven Approach**: Utilized comprehensive EHR data, identifying novel predictors like mood disorders and preventive care markers.

#### **Performance Metrics**

- Models excelled in identifying high-risk individuals, particularly with shorter prediction windows.
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis highlighted key contributing factors, such as age and cerebrovascular disease.

### Practical Implications

- **Clinical Integration**: These models could help identify at-risk patients earlier, enabling timely intervention and personalized care.
- **Research Applications**: Enhanced patient stratification for clinical trials and epidemiological studies.

### Future Directions

To further advance ADRD prediction:
1. **Broader Validation**: Test models with external datasets to ensure generalizability.
2. **Workflow Integration**: Develop clinical tools for seamless use in healthcare settings.
3. **Exploratory Research**: Investigate causal mechanisms behind identified predictors.

## Conclusion

This study highlights the transformative potential of machine learning in healthcare, showcasing how data-driven methodologies can lead to earlier detection and improved outcomes for Alzheimerâ€™s and related dementias. By integrating predictive models into clinical practice, we can take significant steps toward proactive and personalized patient care.
